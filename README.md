Project Summary & Outcomes
This project consolidated user event data from two platforms — Customer360 and Meesho — into a unified, clean dataset to better understand customer behavior across touchpoints. By standardizing event types, sessionizing user activity, and scoring engagement, the analysis quantified the level of interaction customers have with our products.

Key steps included:

Data cleansing and schema alignment for reliable integration of heterogeneous data sources.

Defining user sessions based on 30-minute inactivity windows to capture meaningful user visits.

Assigning weighted scores to different event types, allowing a unified engagement metric.

Performing cohort analysis to track user retention over time and identify drop-off trends.

Business Insights:

High engagement scores correlate to increased user loyalty and long-term value.

Cohort retention analysis highlights critical periods where users tend to disengage, guiding targeted marketing and product improvement efforts.

Differentiating and comparing data sources aids strategic focus on platforms and channels generating the most valuable user interactions.
